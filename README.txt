Phase 1: Created the webpage interface with css and html and made it responsive to the user, managed to take in user input from frontend and sent it to the backend, got user data to interact with mySql through  setting up the Login and signup Feature, and sent response back to frontend. 

Phase 2: Designed the user form and list display and implemented the search feature where I sent the info to the server and displayed the results in a list. I did part of the review where I got info form selected items and I setup the backened function of review.
